Q1. Create a scatter plot between cylinder vs Co2Emission (green color)

Code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
file_path = 'FuelConsumption (1).csv'  # Ensure the file is in the same directory or provide the full path
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
plt.scatter(data['CYLINDERS'], data['CO2EMISSIONS'], color='green')
plt.title('Cylinder vs CO2Emission')
plt.xlabel('Cylinder')
plt.ylabel('CO2 Emissions (g/km)')
plt.show()

Output:


Q2. Using scatter plot compare data   cylinder vs Co2Emission and Enginesize Vs Co2Emission using different colors

Q3. Using scatter plot compare data   cylinder vs Co2Emission and Enginesize Vs Co2Emission and FuelConsumption_comb Co2Emission using different colors

Q4. Train your model with independent variable as cylinder and dependent variable as Co2Emission

Q5. Train another model with independent variable as FuelConsumption_comb and dependent variable as Co2Emission

Q6. Train your model on different train test ratio and train the models and note down their accuracies
